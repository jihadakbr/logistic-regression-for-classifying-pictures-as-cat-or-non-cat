## Objective

This report details the development of a straightforward image recognition algorithm aimed at accurately classifying pictures as either cat or non-cat. The dataset provided, named "data.h5," comprises two sets: a training set with m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0), and a test set with m_test images similarly labeled.

Each image in the dataset has a shape of (num_px, num_px, 3), where the number 3 represents the three channels (RGB). This means that each image is square, with the height and width both equal to num_px.

Throughout this project, I successfully constructed the image-recognition algorithm, enabling it to classify images with impressive accuracy, distinguishing between cat and non-cat images effectively. The methodology involved in this process, along with the results achieved, demonstrates the algorithm's capability and showcases my proficiency in image recognition techniques.
